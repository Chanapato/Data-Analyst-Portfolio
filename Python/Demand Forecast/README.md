# Machine Learning - Demand Forecast
## Problem Statement
Demand forecasting has been a major challenge in the food industry for managing inventories and increasing customer satisfaction, particularly in the food-to-go section where the products need to be manufactured in advance. 

In this case, the real data was taken from a sandwich store, that I have been working with, has had unpredictably fluctuating consumer demand, which has resulted in stock-out or overstock issues.

## Process


## Conclusion
A voting regression ensemble model has been proposed for the analysis of food-to-go demand forecasting by using three standalone machine learning algorithms: linear regression, XGBoost, and random forest.
