Patrick O.,5,1 June 2023,Bluetooth Speaker,"Really good product, the bass is really Powerful for a small speaker but there is no distortion at high volume, I highly recommend!"
Kloè Farrugia-Hutchings,5,21 May 2023,Love,I absolutely love this speaker. When listening to music and watching movies the sound is perfect.
Gail,1,20 May 2023,Save your money,"Gave the speaker a full charge. It registered that it had 100% battery. The speaker didn't last longer than 3 hours. Also the speaker played intermittently ie the music came through but kept breaking up, sometimes stopped playing like I'd paursed the music. The speaker was the only thing connected to my phone so no interference from anything else.Don't waste your money buying this item. Buy cheap get cheap."
Lesley B.,5,17 May 2023,Excellent,"This is perfect for the car.Sounds great, looks good, works really well.Good price"
Paul Wright,3,8 May 2023,quality,decent sound but battery life not so good
gary crilly,5,3 May 2023,Great Value Quality Product,Great product at a great price and super fast delivery.
Welder,1,2 May 2023,Very,Very little  volume
Mr J Rose,2,30 April 2023,Poor,Returned
Amazon Customer,1,19 April 2023,the base boost button stopped working after a few weeks,it was ok but as soon as counted to a laptopmthe soiunf went and some buttons such as bass boost stopped working
Outlander83,1,17 April 2023,WASTE OF MONEY,About once a minute it cute out for a second which is incredibly annoying. I tried contacting the seller but no reply and it would have been too expensive to return.AVOID AVOID AVOID.
Vikki nash,3,7 April 2023,Not as loud as I expected,It's ok but not worth the money
Siobhan,1,7 April 2023,Volume has a mind of it's own,Perhaps I got a faulty one but it seems to do what it wants with volume. I noticed it had gotten very quiet and assumed it was because the battery was decreasing (it was at 20%). I turned the volume up using the buttons on the speaker and plugged it in then 10 minutes later it was absolutely blasting and I had to turn it down. It did this a few days later with a full battery so no connection to charge
Thomas,4,6 April 2023,Are they any good,"I found this speaker adequate, nothing outstanding., Bluetooth broke up when I was about 15 feet away from it and not very loud."
jmo,1,6 April 2023,Not loud enough,Was looking for a louder wireless speaker to match the one which is no longer available. Unfortunately to drown out background noise at work it's just not enough for me. It cuts out as well frequently
Mr T,2,5 April 2023,"When a web vid has a very low volume on th puter,  the max sound volume is still too quiet.",If the original volume signal is weak; even to put this device on max volume will not give a much better audible sound. And it would be better to get proper buttons for setting the volume??? Or for switching on and off? These push buttons for setting the volume stepwise without any bip are a pain.
tonks,5,30 March 2023,Good little speaker for price,Sound quality lacking but not bad due to price
Aaron,3,28 March 2023,Loud is a stretch.,"""Loud"" isn't the word I'd use to describe this speaker, it's not loud at all.Battery life is very good, but the bass is non existent."
Lee,3,28 March 2023,Not that loud,Not that loud
Mrs. P. J. Beeching,5,26 March 2023,Useful little gadget,"Very efficient little wireless speaker.  I paired it with an Echo Dot with no problems and it happily read a voice-enabled Kindle book to me with excellent tone and volume. The battery charges reasonably fast with the cable supplied and it also has cable for headphones, the jacks for which are behind a rubber bung on the back of the speaker - attached by two ‘cords’ to avoid losing it.  In the compartment is also a red light which turns green to indicate that the the battery is fully charged.The only grumble I have is that whilst the instructions for pairing are good, the explanation of what the operating buttons are for is very tiny and hard to read!  In all other respects, this is a lovely thing to add to your Alexa enabled gadgets to extend their  usefulness."
Robert N.,1,17 March 2023,Waste of money,Supposed to be a loud bluetooth speaker my phone was just as loud as this item was returned
Steve,5,16 March 2023,A good quality product,For the money this speaker is excellent value as the sound is clear and can be set to a good volume. I'm pleased I bought it.
JH312,5,13 March 2023,An absolute beaut.,"It’s small, easy to use, compact, fastens onto any device Bluetooth signal I’ve ever wanted to use it for like a shark and has a very good battery life, range and sound. It doesn’t take long to recharge.My only suggestion might be that it’s buttons are quite difficult to see in low light so I highlighted them.Perfect now.And otherwise a fantastic little unit."
Filipe Ferreira,5,13 March 2023,Top quality for money,Top quality for money
Amazon Customer,5,11 March 2023,Bluetooth speaker,Hi loves it
Maximiliano Barbieri,3,11 March 2023,Good value for the money but no good sound quality,It’s not a JBL or SONY I know but the sound is not clear and if you press the BASS booster the sound quality is worstI’m thinking in sending it back and expend a bit more for a decent one
Amazon Customer,1,8 March 2023,Dangerous!!,Bought this two years ago and was happy until tested when I plugged in to change. The charging wire melted and almost caused a fire.
ThomasMurphy,5,7 March 2023,"Great speaker, easy to set up and great sound.",Great sound. Very easy to connect and it has great sound.

Armaan,5,20 February 2023,Shocking how good it is for the price,Amazing quality of sound with little to no downsides. Literally perfect would recommend to everyone especially for the price.
brgrinch,4,6 February 2023,The sound is not bad for the price,"It works. The sound is not bad for the price. Does not easily connect wirelessly to some devices and have to resort to a wired connection. As a simple added comment, althoigh I understand why all the buttons are black, in low light it makes them difficult to see. Alaso the use of the ""M"" button is not explained at all."
Big D,5,2 February 2023,great speaker,"bought this for work, sound us great plenty of volume easy to use, perfect."
Kevin odonnell,5,25 January 2023,Small but loud!,A smashing little speaker. It it small but loud and I like the fact you have an option to turn off bass from top of speaker. It’s compact and solid and the sound is very good and not tinny as some can be. All in all good value for money. 👍👌
Ian Mitchell,4,22 January 2023,Very good,"Sound quality is good, easy to use and connect too, solid build, quick charge, would recommend, perfect for taking into garage, garden etc"

ian mussell,5,15 January 2023,Excellent sound quality.,"Great speaker.It does everything i need in a portable speaker.Solid build,Long lasting battery,excellent sound output."
Ems,5,15 January 2023,Really great sound for the price,"Did a lot of research before purchasing this speaker. Read all the reviews and I am so pleased that I ordered it. Sound is really good, easy to connect and battery life lasts long. Great for having in smaller spaces which is what I was looking for. Would definitely recommend for the price."
JU,2,11 January 2023,Not happy with this product,"The sound is very poor, more like radio sound with no speakers. The volume not that much too.  Much as there is a button for bass, there is no sound like bass.  The speaker is so tiny and light, not at all what I expected.  Bottom line; delivery was perfect but am not happy with the product, thanks"
Nicola Bull,5,9 January 2023,Christmas Present,Partner was really pleased with this as he had lost his other one in luggage sound battery life etc is all spot on
Accurate Reviews,5,5 January 2023,Very Great!,"This Bluetooth shower speaker is really powerful and well made, I bought it as a present for a friend's birthday! I absolutely recommend it!"

hi,4,22 December 2022,Not bad for a cheap speaker,"Speaker quality is decent, and better than expected for this price! It is definitely loud enough and battery life is decent as well. If you need a cheap portable speaker this is great."
Tony,3,22 December 2022,Good sound and seems like a robust build.,Very good price and loud enough for my needs.
Jimbob1393,2,15 December 2022,Not the best,"Product is decent quality as in build. Cannot get it to connect to my Alexa despite following instructions which are not that clear and don’t seem to match the process in the Alexa app anyhow. This was the reason I bought this item.Have connected it to my phone Apple phone, but every time I want to use the speaker I have to forget the item in the phone settings and then find it again and it works then. Not idealI would not recommend this, sorry, it doesn’t do what I wanted it for despite selecting this item as it said it did.The sound quality is good when it does work and use it in the bathroom and wanted it as an extension of my Alexa product"
FUNKY MARTYN,4,12 December 2022,Good for less than £18.,"Got this speaker this week.  So giving it a test via Bluetooth from a Fiio M7 player.  Not tried sticking a sd card in direct or aux cable  etc . It's OK for this price.  The battery charge light is a red blinking at the rear and goes out when full.  One thing I must add...mine is usb c  not old micro . Also smooth rear , and not the square passive radiator type  ? .  So yes it won't beat my jbl ones but OK so far."
Dwight B.,5,6 December 2022,Nice bit if kit,Love the size and sounds it generates.
MichaelS,1,6 December 2022,Great but just stopped working suddenly,"I was well pleased with the speaker performance, easy bluetooth connection to my mobile and its battery life.Sadly it just suddenly stopped working properly. :-(Very very slight sound coming from it I I held my ear to it but volume controls did nothing.Returned for refund and ordered another in the hope that it was just a faulty batch.Time will tell."
Saamer Jasem,1,3 December 2022,Stopped working after a month and seller won't provide a refund!!!,"It was great when it worked but suddenly stopped pairing to any devices, rendering it a brick. Reported to seller and Amazon and absolutely nothing has happened! No refund and no replacement!!! AVOID!"
JAMES,5,28 November 2022,Good product and good value.,"Nice looking, good sound and easy setup."
Phil Beynon,5,27 November 2022,Nifty little speaker!,"So far this has far exceeded expectations!I got this for listening to music in the garden, bath, whilst doing DIY around the place as the phone speaker's not that loud.Sound clarity is really good, range is good, not tried it at its maximum volume, but its pretty loud!Its quite heavily built and looks like it should last. The cover on the rear to protect sockets etc is a nice touch."
george,5,20 November 2022,Good cheap speaker,Very good value for money never lets me down
Spike42,3,20 November 2022,Disappointing but ok.,"After reading the 5* reviews I was expecting better sound, bass and stereo.  It works fine and looks good. The instructions were very unhelpful. I still can't work out what the M button does."
SQUIDEX,5,20 November 2022,Great,Fantastic
John Boyett,2,20 November 2022,Quiet,Not loud enough.

Dougie Ross,5,9 November 2022,Don't have DAB radio in the car this speaker & your phone is a good second.,"This is a good second best if you don't have a DAB radio, sometimes its better in poor reception areas. Speaker life's okay & sound quality good. Still to use it on holiday, but pretty sure it'll be good."
Patience Okpiabhele,5,9 November 2022,Awesome!!! I'm enjoying it.,"Good product I must confess, the bass is awesome. I think it's ok for  that amount."

gillian philbin,5,5 November 2022,Brilliant speaker,Sounds fantastic and really loud great speaker for the price highly recommended
obi,2,4 November 2022,Not really what I expected,It looks good and sounds okay but only in a small enclosed area. I wanted something that will fill the living room and it came up short.
c j lockwood,5,28 October 2022,Great little unit,Great sound and battery life.
Ceasar K.,4,27 October 2022,Good speaker loud enough,Proper for the price abd battery very good
snowflake,3,26 October 2022,Okish,Well Ibhavexa small problem .It cuts out sometimes.Must be bluetooth.Have contacted supplier but no answer of yet Been 48 hrs.The sound quality is ok. It's not quite so good as other views suggested.It serves a purpose
ali Jalilvand,5,25 October 2022,Very good. Good sound. Happy with it.,Good sound
Joe,5,24 October 2022,Excellent quality,Gone through a load of Bluetooth speakers and can definitely say these are the best I’ve come across. Perfect sound quality and the bass mode is something else! Used it straight out the box without charging and has lasted for over 2 days of 8 hour use. Can’t go wrong for the price of these
Andy W.,2,23 October 2022,Not all round sound,Poor sound quality
tobase,5,22 October 2022,Sounds good!,"Nice ,small,  inexpensive, outside speaker for the garden party"
Amazon Customer,5,21 October 2022,Excellent value for money product.,"For the money, was very pleased with this product. Nicely sits on my laptop, and produces a very pleasant sound when playing music from the laptop."
Eamon,1,15 October 2022,Terrible experience,"But I won't, refund my money and stop scammer  tactics"
Nathan Ward,5,11 October 2022,ace,rules
louise reid,5,8 October 2022,Very good value for money,Great value
Pepper,4,4 October 2022,Really good,Just what i needed for watching broadcasts and films and also for carrying speaker around when visuals aren't important and needing to get ready for work etc. Amazing to have a waterproof one for bathroom. Small but powerful. And it has a strong sound quality. The carry handle is really helpful too.
Stephen O'Sullivan,5,4 October 2022,Really good speaker. Surprising sound quality!,"Really impressed with this, stuck it on to test it, really clear music, surprisingly excellent stereo space (with just the one speaker, there are a few speakers inside it). Decent bass, considering the size of the speaker. Bought it for the shower but will use it a lot more than that, might even end up getting something else for the shower as this is too good and will be used elsewhere - dammit! haha."
R. Puri,5,2 October 2022,It’s a great device,I really like it… the only thing is that the sound level goes too high or too low when you changing from one volume lower or higher. And when you switch it on it’s alway on full volume.
Nicola Keenan,5,2 October 2022,Compact Bluetooth Speaker,Fabulous sound quality
JM,5,1 October 2022,Great little speaker.,"I’ve got a few of these Bluetooth speakers from various manufacturers, and in the main I’m very disappointed with them because they don’t always connect to my devices - they spend ages looking for them, despite being previously linked they fail to work. I think they get confused if you’ve linked them to more than one device.HOWEVER - this little beauty works perfectly and flawlessly every time; I think just having my phone connected to it, and nothing else helps quite a bit. The richness of the sound, and the bass level is superb, perfect for what I want it, playing audio books.A great buy, I’m glad I bought it."
Mikejop,5,30 September 2022,Amazing speaker for its size.,Amazing speaker for its size
penny,5,29 September 2022,Great product,I brought this speaker for my son who really likes it he says it's got great sound quality and he really likes the fact that he can listen to his music at full volume and the speaker doesn't distort the quality of the music
Ian Tarrantula,1,28 September 2022,Dissapointed,When connected via Bluetooth the song freezes and then speeds up to catch up with itself. Tried on 2 different phones with the same results. Gets quite annoying after a while. Battery does last a long time but sadly I am returning due to issue of it freezing
Mrs SM Farish,4,27 September 2022,Great as an additional speaker in the house.,"Works well in the house, not really loud enough for outdoor use but I wanted it to hear the radio when I was in the bathroom, so just what was needed.Battery life could be better and you don't get much warning when it's running out."
max,5,27 September 2022,Great speaker,Great speaker sound really good
Number Six,3,24 September 2022,Mediocre sound box,"Arrived on time and we’ll packed. Connecting is easy. Looks nice So not ugly. Charging is a small usb cable, no battery supply needed. Holds charge for a few days of use. But… it’s very low sound. Feeling like it’s not got the juice to play loud outside.  So if you want volume, I’d not be confident to recommend"
Andrew John Morrow,5,22 September 2022,Ideal for playing music when I am in the shower.,Great for in the garden and the shower. Sound quality good enough for my untrained ears. Great battery life too.
Babatunde Olanrewaju,1,21 September 2022,Not good,"Bad sound quality, Bluetooth doesn’t also work"
James Hooper,4,21 September 2022,It’s class,You must buy worth every penny only annoying thing is when it says battery low
K. M. Kumar,2,21 September 2022,gets bit jumpy when playing through Windows device,"Overall looks good build and quality.But noticed started getting bit jumpy when playing songs through windows device.  Tried to update the Bluetooth driver, re-paired several times but still same issue.When unplugged, the music plays as expected through PC speakers, so definitely problem with device."
L. Kyei,1,20 September 2022,After Six Months It Stops Working,"This speaker was ok, sound was clear and had good base and I really enjoyed it. Until it just stopped connecting to my device and automatically switching itself after 10 secs of being connected. Pretty disappointed I purchased in April 2022 and it stopped working in September 2022."
Emily Astley,5,20 September 2022,Great speaker for price! 🌟 5 stars,Cracking speaker for price. Definitely worth it. Just wish battery life was abit better
jan10,1,20 September 2022,This speaker keeps cutting off 😒,This speaker keeps cutting out mid songs and right throughout the songs tried to contact company but sadly  😔 no reply
Nivern mpofu,5,14 September 2022,Good value for your money,"Really enjoy the product. Good quality sound, great value for your money"
ray buddin,4,13 September 2022,lovely little speaker,speaker just right for listening outside....allthough not much difference to sound when you press 'Bass' button which you dont need anyway. my last bluetooth speaker did have longer battery life but this is adequate enough
nicola,5,11 September 2022,For the price very good sound quality good,For the price this product is very good sound quality is good and the battery life is very good
McB,5,6 September 2022,Great Speaker,"Bought this for my niece who's going off to college - she loves it! Great sound, loud, portable, good battery life but may also be plugged in via USB. Superb value for money"
Lee,3,4 September 2022,customer support didn't reply as I had a faulty cable. But product is good.,Speaker works great. But cables are TERRIBLE quality. Customer service didn't get back to me about a new cable. So only 3 stars here.
Abeer Elkordy,5,3 September 2022,Excellent,It’s excellent highly recommended
Mix0182,2,2 September 2022,Great if you miss the nostalgic way music sounded when you jogged with a discman.,"Other than the fact that it sounds like you're lostening to a scratch CD with the amount of time the music cuts out, granted for less than a second a time but 10 times a song no matter how close my phone is to it its so annoying!Other than that it's not tinny and packs a decent punch great with base mode on. Couldn't for the life of me get it to be found on my alexa app either"
Amazon Customer,2,2 September 2022,If you like you music to keep dropping out every 30 seconds. It's great,Like Bluetooth was years ago .keeps dropping out.
Tina Lewis,5,1 September 2022,Good value sounds great,Perfect for travel and sounds good in my Motorhome
Raymond,3,30 August 2022,Not brilliant,"It's okay if in a house, don't try in a depot with other back ground noise."
Liz,2,29 August 2022,Randomly stopped working,"The speaker itself is really good however, it just randomly stopped working. I’ve attempted the reset function but that doesn’t do anything. I’d like a refund or to be sent a new one - it’s a lot of money considering I haven’t had it long."
Rob Patterson,1,28 August 2022,Audio cuts out,Don't waste your money
Amazon Customer,5,27 August 2022,Finally a speaker I can be happy with,"After trying lots of small speakers to use at home. This speaker popped up and was affordable. It is perfect. It house good sound, the battery lasts well. It also doesn’t play quieter when the battery needs charging…well that hasn’t happened yet because the battery is still going since the first charge.Also, it is a perfect size."
Peter Q. G.,4,24 August 2022,A very good deal,"This is a well made piece of kit that produces a good sound for such a small unit. Seems a bargaing £29.99.One point I should raise though is that it says on the information that the output is 14 watts. In fact it's only 7 watts per speaker, so you'd have to buy a pair to get it to 14.And the bass button isn't much use because all it really does is muffle the sound.If it wasn't for those two points it would be 5's all round.And by the way, why am I being asked to mark for noise. Just what is meant by 'noise'. If you mean clarity of sound then say so."
M.Bain,5,24 August 2022,Saw a review in which Magazine,"Saw a review in which Magazine regarding this speaker, which said for the price it was good value.Thought I would give it a go as was after another speaker anyway.It's not up there with my bose portable speakers but then neither is the price.Soundwise, as mentioned not up there with bose mini, but it's still very good. In fact I would say for pairing with tablet to watch films etc then it would be my preferred choice as not so bassy. Music wise, few tweaks of equaliser on phone or tablet it's still rather good and rather loud as well. Overall I am happy with my purchase"
Nicola Brown,5,24 August 2022,Lovely sound for the price,"Small and portable, great for the beach and garden. It’s not run out on me yet. Such a good price for a little music box! So pleased!"
Lewis,5,22 August 2022,Great quality waterproof speaker.,I bought this to use kayak camping hence the waterproof feature. Worked great and even dunked it a few times in the water. Charge time and sound quality is pretty good for the money!
DGoulston,2,20 August 2022,"Bit jumpy,  not great","When a new song starts is very jumpy and pauses for a second,  also can go bitty in a song.  Tested with other speaker and is fine,  so defo is this product not the device sending the music"

Simon86,5,16 August 2022,Fantastic product!,great value for money and puts out some good sound for it!battery life is excellent
mike1988,3,15 August 2022,Sound,"I bought this as a friend I worked with had one and it was amazing. He had his phone connected to his and mine and sound was perfect. Mine however plays loud and clear and battery is perfect. But I can assure you that on atleast every song the sound suddenly cuts out for atleast a second. I thought it was my connection to the Internet so I downloaded some songs and it still did the same, so my only thought is that there is a Bluetooth issue with this item as my phone works perfectly on other speakers. Its a shame really this item gives one hell of a boost to any song. But when you're singing along and next thing you know your belting out a work when there's no sound is abit embarrassing when it happens."
Sam butt,1,15 August 2022,Sound battery and noise,Sound quality was not good battery timing was not good and too much noise level
JOHN BILLINGE,5,14 August 2022,Excellent little speaker,"Does exactly what I bought it for , great sound and battery life - I never normally review but this product has been great and used lots in the garden with the good weather"

Lorna C,5,13 August 2022,"Great speaker, great price","Great for the money, can take any where as small enough and delivered quickly"
Chris,5,10 August 2022,"Nice sound, long battery life, great when paired with another","Really pleased with this speaker, for the price I think its great.Nice clear sound , plenty of volume for when sitting out in the garden; but my favourite feature is that you can pair 2 together and they work as a stereo pair ( I purchased another after being impressed with the first one to do exactly this)When paired, volume cranked up and bass mode on they really do 'belt out the music'Great Fun!!!!"
Ebenezer Kumi,5,10 August 2022,Good choice,Excellent sound

sergio,5,13 July 2022,Really good quality,Long live battery and good quality sound.
chasggg,1,13 July 2022,Don't waste your money.,"I bought this speaker to replace my smaller old one at work which didn't get through the whole day. At first it was great and I thought problem solved, getting through the entire day with 60% or more battery remaining and the sound was good enough......... Fast forward to today, only 2½ months later, and I'm now having to use the old speaker to take over when this rubbish dies on me after only three quarters of my shift.As I said in the heading, don't waste your money."
Reader,1,11 July 2022,Stopped charging after 2 months,After 2 months of use the device stopped charging. There is no charging indicator. I tried different cables to no avail. You get what you pay for.
wisptis.exe,5,11 July 2022,Incredible quality for the price,"It takes some finagling between the speaker's volume settings and your device's volume settings, but if you get it juuust right, you can get some killer bass out of this little thing. I've never submerged it in water, but I'm not shy about touching it with wet hands or keeping it in the steamy bathroom during a shower and it's had no effect on the speakers.My only real complaint is that the ""dead battery"" sound scares the **** out of me if we forget to turn it off before bed. It's SO LOUD!!! However, the joy we get from the lady saying ""BASS MOW"" when you switch the sound to bass mode makes up for that only flaw. It's a meme in our household now.I recommend giving this speaker a try. Sounds great, doesn't feel cheap at all--it's really solid. Looks like it's on sale for £25 right now, too. It's really a steal."

E. J. Hankin,5,20 June 2022,Great all-rounder and waterproof,"Great little speaker and it comes with an AUX cable for attaching to output device.  And this cable does make a difference to the sound quality compared to Bluetooth, which is also very, very good.  Handy little fabric handle makes for an easy shower speaker - hang it from the sliding door handle. Really pleased as this was to replace my old ANKER speaker (4 years old and died).  It wasn't until I got the new speaker that I realised how bad the sound quality and battery life had become on the old one. No regrets and 1/2 the price I paid for the ANKER"

mr.peter kopyrko,5,25 May 2022,excellent build quality,Excellent speaker for the money paid
Rez,3,24 May 2022,Nothing special,"I mean for the price, if your looking for a loud speaker then this will do. But for an individual like me who has an ear for good, quality sound it just did not sit right. The unit itself was very small and light weight making me think the components/drivers aren't that large. The bass just sounded very artificial.Overall my opinion is, it's just not my cup of tea. I'm going to look at spending a little more for quality speakers, maybe Anker"
Paul,1,24 May 2022,Sound cuts out every few mins... Bluetooth seems to stutter,Sound cuts out every few mins... Bluetooth seems to stutter really annoying. Still have not heard back from the seller regarding a replacement speaker !!!

Ellie Braiden,5,12 May 2022,Great for those trips away where space is limited,"Great little speaker for the price. The battery lasted a whole weeks holiday, playing it everyday.

Mr M.,5,9 May 2022,Excellent sound from such a small speaker platform. Highly recommend it.,"Superb sound for its size and good battery life.

Consumer,5,7 May 2022,Brilliant replacement,This is an ideal size and replacement for my previous portable speaker. Would recommend
Michael Organ,4,5 May 2022,Would have been 5 star but,"Great little speaker deserved a 5 star but for a few niggles. The Bluetooth goes to sleep, yes it needs waking up which is strange. Maybe it's me but it happened on 2 phones 2 echo dots and a Samsung smart TV, all current gen equipment. If you want it to connect to an echo dot for wake up alarm think again. However range is fantastic better than all my other devices.It's a dust magnet. I use powder for skin problems so when I take it to the bathroom it literally comes out covered, seems to attract every particle. Easy to clean though. It's because the finish is soft brushed rubber. If you don't mind that the handling is nice.The jack's have a cover that obstructs plugging in cables, not a huge problem but everything is black which for someone like me with poor eyesight can be an issue.Having said all that, unless one or more of those niggles is a deal breaker you will find better at the price. It's better than many my friends bought for twice or three times the price."
Ellis,1,2 May 2022,Product doesn’t connect to phone. Instructions give zero guide on how to fix this.,Straight up doesn’t connect to phones and the instructions given offer no support or help fixing this glaring issue.

Amazon Customer,5,14 April 2022,Great for how cheap and how small it is!,"For the product being so small and fairly cheap, I wasn't expecting it to be so clear and have good bass.The battery life is actually pretty good lasting around 12-16 hours at the highest volume with the bass + setting active.I have no real problems with the product itself except the charging... there is no indication when it's fully charged, however. It takes around 3 hours from 0- 100% you'll just need to remember that it's on charge.Very worth the money and better than expected."
R,5,11 April 2022,Best speaker I’ve brought,Great sound quality best one I’ve brought

Drip fed fred,5,3 April 2022,Bluetooth speaker,"Fantastic speaker. Great sound from a portable speaker. Bass mode is great. You dont need a midi hifi for the shed-garage.  Pair this to your phone, and off you go.Also takes an sd card, and has aux lead for ipod classic etc.An absoloute bargain."
Tomahawk,1,2 April 2022,Broke after 2nd use,"Been wanting a half decent Bluetooth speaker for when I'm working in the garage and this seemed ideal.Good battery life, the sound is pretty decent for its size and it paired with no issues whatsoever.Now onto the bad.After it's 2nd use the power button stopped working unless it was plugged in to charge which kind of defeats the purpose of a wireless speaker. The battery reads 100% but the moment you unplug the lead it just shuts off instantly.I looked through the manual and there is nothing on this, which is a shame because for the price, it was pretty decent to begin with.Now it's just a paperweight."
Ms T,1,1 April 2022,Awful,Avoid this product.  Stopped working and there is no after sales support.
Dazza,5,31 March 2022,Daughter very happy.,For the price I paid I think this is a great speaker.Wirh the added extra base setting certainly produces a great sound for the price.
Sojad,3,31 March 2022,Broke after two months…,"Without me dropping it or anything, the quality durastically declined within two months (the Base has become louder than the actual vocals of the music). The worst £30 ive spent on amazon and ive been buying for over 5 years. Too late to refund now aswell but very poor quality and I miss my old speaker so much now"
Suraj,1,29 March 2022,Poor sound quality,The diaphram was vibrating when bass song song was played and the vocals go down
ben g.,5,26 March 2022,Mega!,Proper quality piece of kit great sound quality and excellent value. Very happy with the purchase.
Charleen,5,25 March 2022,Brilliant for outdoor fun.,Brilliant value for money. Would highly recommend
Sina Madani,5,25 March 2022,Incredible quality for the price,"I was pleasantly surprised by this inexpensive speaker. Its appearance is inoffensive and functional, it doesn't look cheap, abd nor does it sound cheap either. It gets loud enough over Bluetooth, has some sound separation (given it's a single speaker), feels powerful and has decent frequency range. It also has good connectivity options. This is far superior to the Zamkol ZK606 in its build and sound quality. It's also better than the JBL Go 3, but that's to be expected, given this is 12W and larger. My only criticism is that Bass boost mode doesn't really improve the bass substantially, it just makes it sound more muffled. However as standard the speaker has good tuning and bass so overall I think this is a fantastic speaker for the price."
Karen A.,5,23 March 2022,Great speakèr,Very easy to use
Robert McDonald,1,20 March 2022,I am sound person and level his not expectations,The advert of this product don't match it. Make out the sound and was good ..I have not best yet ... Truly I wish I bought Bose instead
Dave Davies,4,18 March 2022,"Nothing special, but you can't complain at that price.","The sound quality isn't amazing and the Bluetooth connectivity is sometimes a bit flaky but at that price point you get what you pay for. I've used it to upgrade laptop audio and for that purpose it works perfectly well. OK, it's not quite as loud as Bose Soundlink, but it's a tenth of the price."

Alexander Lewis,4,20 February 2022,Stopped working,Sound is great but very disappointed with the product durability.
Mr. T. M. Elner,2,14 February 2022,"Decent shower speaker, good volume, instructions useless","EDIT - 4 stars down to 2. Whenever I use this speaker I get constant cut outs in the sound. This doesn't happen on any of my other BT speakers, only this one. Its annoying to the point that I don't use this if I can help it.I bought this as a shower/bath speaker so just wanted something with some decent volume, good bass and waterproof.Before I review those aspects, my main frustration for ages was the pairing mode and the instructions make no mention of it. Turn the speaker on and by default it is in pairing mode, so you pair your first device. Now, want to add a second one? Well turning on the speaker will auto connect to the first one, so you have to turn the bluetooth off on that one first. While that doesn't sound that bad, consider the fact that you might be about to jump in the shower but someone else used the speaker before you and is in a different room, now you need to go get them to turn off their BT.After pressing numerous buttons however I think I finally figured out that you can re-pair by holding down the play button. Usually it would be a case of holding the power button when turning on.With that out of the way....Volume - very good, loud enough to make my shower shakeBass - Great but will distort. For the price, excellentBattery - Not had to even charge it yet out of the box. Plenty for me (used about 5 hours so far, device reports 40% charge over bluetooth)Waterproof - its survived a couple of showers already, I'll be sure to update the review if that changesOverall I'm happy with this purchase."

nodfromaccy,3,21 January 2022,OK Product but Volume Drops as Battery Runs Down,Sound is good and battery life OK. The main issue I have is that the volume drops as the battery runs low and then comes up again some time after it has recharged. I find this really annoying.
Amazon Customer,5,20 January 2022,Great value for money,"I bought this speaker so I could play music outside my house alongside my other decorations over Christmas, I tucked it out of sight and streamed music to it from my iPad.

alan wigley,3,12 January 2022,Not bad,Not bad for the money… sound is ok… however I was comparing to a Bose sound wave
The Sun of David,1,9 January 2022,The Anker is better.,Sound is nice and clear but i wouldn't rate it for bass. The Anker is much better.The bass button doesn't always work when you press it.Overall I think it's hyped up in the description and misleading.Sounds like a radio speaker to me. The primary focus sound wise is on the mid-range and top-range. Overall i would say the Anker is better.

popadog,3,3 January 2022,A good unit -- when sold at half-price in sale!,"A good overall sound when I got it paired and working. No instructions included so had to contact Amazon for guidance. They were very helpful. Without Amazon's good customer service intervention, it would have been returned for refund. Buttons on top are big -- that's good, but printed black-on-black so they're almost impossible to see -- had to shine a torch light on it to see the buttons. Slick rubbery design -- but don't believe the video because it's over-hyped. A good unit -- when sold at half-price in sale!"

Mozart,2,6 December 2021,"Speaker is too ""SMART""","Support will ignore you.Sound and build quality is good, but there is big BUT.Speaker have a smart system of preserving energy by turning off sound in ""quite enough moments that its safe to say nothing is playing"" like ambient sound, or pauses between dialogs. Problem is that you can hear white noise when speakers is active and you can hear those cuts really well, really annoying and disappointed that speaker is not dumb enough to just play a sound when i press play."
Michael,4,5 December 2021,Strong robust,Music and movies on the move. One question if I buy another can they be linked together?
DH,5,5 December 2021,Good speaker,Son uses it when playing football with his mates impressed

Pam,5,30 November 2021,Good Quality,I use for my therapy room for  relaxing music. Very happy with it.
MR,5,26 November 2021,Superb bit of kit,Have used this connected (via Bluetooth) to my PC and Alexa and the connection is easy and the sound superb and the battery life just seems to go on and on.  Highly recommend.
Mr Richard Hulse,5,26 November 2021,An impressive piece of kit. Most excellent!,"Surprisingly good quality sound, even at the highest volume.

Happy to recommend it!"

Todd,3,22 November 2021,Is only working not BT,Bluetooth not pairing my device keeps saying cudnt connect all of my other devices are great  but only the aux works for this one try the reset as well still having the same problem what to do ???....
Liam C,1,20 November 2021,Buy Anker instead,This is the worst speaker I’ve ever bought. Even worse than the 10 pound one I bought in Poundland.The battery life is awful. I have an Anker Soundcore that’s like 4 years old and had daily use in that time and it’s far and away better than this piece of junk. I started a return on this but accidentally dropped it and it has a big dent in it. Not sturdy at all and already has rust on it. Whatever you do do not buy this. The sound is crap. I get more volume out of sticking my phone speaker under a toilet roll. The bass option is useless as it lowers the sound by 10 fold. Avoid like the plague!
Mr A.,5,15 November 2021,Excellent,"We took this on holiday, my husband is a bit of a tech snob, so wasn’t expecting a good sound.. but boy was he surprised, he has raved about it to all that would listen! Really good sound, great battery life"
A. Findley,5,15 November 2021,Excellent value speaker,Very impressed with this little speaker. Used with my laptop for room filling sound of my music.Would recommend - only poor and unnecessary feature is the bass enhancement button which just makes the sound muddy and spoils the clarity. Better without it.
Kieran T,5,14 November 2021,Very impressed!,This is an awesome speaker! When looking for a new speaker I saw the high level reviews and ratings which persuaded me to give it a go! Seriously good sound quality and it plays mega loud whilst retaining the sound quality! I've actually bought a second one just becuase I was so impressed with the first!
Darrell  lennon,5,13 November 2021,Great product,Second one I’ve brought got my son one a year ago he loved it and just brought my sister the same thing as so good
Matt,5,13 November 2021,Perfect for the bathroom!,"I wanted a bluetooth speaker so I could listen to some podcasts while in the shower/bathroom. This speaker is great for that with good audio level, clear audio and waterproof rating. I've been using it everyday for around 30 minute and a single charge has lasted over 20 days so far so battery life also seems good."
Dominic Milne,5,11 November 2021,Very good. Works well,Recommend
Angela S McGivern,5,11 November 2021,Excellent purchase,Sound quality is excellent very pleased with purchase
J,5,3 November 2021,Impressed!,"I’m quite awkward when it comes to speakers and headphones, I like rich sounds but without having to pay the premium for someone’s marketing team!I always try and look at lesser known ‘named’ brands and products. Some have been cheap and you get what you pay for. Often ‘tinny’ or bass distorts the sound.Glad to say with this product I have found the sound to be spot on. Clear, rich and great volume (controlled by my phone) with a brilliant battery life (so far). I have been using mine in the bathroom for a shower disco haha and it out performs previous waterproof speakers.For the price it’s decent and a solid 5/5"
Alexander Rae,5,28 October 2021,Great bit of kit.,"Great bit of kit, use it in a tractor ( at the moment) as the radio's not working, have it on most of the day, small to carry about the house if needed."
Dale lane,4,26 October 2021,Fab system,"Great item for its price, very easy to set up sleak and compact, could do with being a little louder."
Mike Shanley,4,22 October 2021,Good Bluetooth Speaker,"Second speaker fine, faulty first speaker and the seller would not get back in touch. Ended up going through Amazon returning the faulty unit for a refund. Quiet pleased with the speaker so reordered another one but had to pay more as the price had increased. The increase was not a lot but was more a matter of principle as the speaker was still under warranty. Amazon refused to replace at the same price."
michelle barlow,5,21 October 2021,Great product  good value,"Great product  , great sound and easy to use"
Mr G P Bosworth,2,18 October 2021,Very poor for handsfree,I bought this as a speaker to boost the phone sound. To be honest it is very poor indeed. After several calls it is not much louder than my phone speaker.  This is not recommended for a hands-free unit
Leah,5,17 October 2021,Great value and sound,"Much better than I expected.  Great sound, great battery.  Really impressed."

ArturoB,3,10 October 2021,Poor bluetooth reception,"I was impressed when I received it. Sound quality seemed good. Main problem during this month, though, is the poor bluetooth connection. Anything makes interferences and produces cracking or disconnection (putting my phone on my pocket or in my hand, having a shower...), which doesn't happen with any of my other bluetooth devices.This morning (after a month of use) now it sounds like it has lost some frequencies especially when playing clips with voice only."
Amazon Customer,4,7 October 2021,Great little speaker,For £30 this is a great little speaker. Feels well made and solid. Sound quality is very good with decent bass middle and treble. It's Bass boost mode seems to mute other frequencies a little but still sounds good. Connects easily through Bluetooth with a long range. Can't comment on battery life cos only had ot a day but overall impressed so far.
Michael Henry,5,6 October 2021,Loud and clear,"The sound quality is great, easy to pair up."
Ryan,4,4 October 2021,Not bad,"For the price, this is really good. If you're expecting something bassy with plenty of boom, this isn't it. I bought it for my car as my stereo system is something out of the Antiques Roadshow and it's perfectly fine for that. There a bit of a hiss when volume is maxed and it's a bassy tune but for the most part it's okay. Will be looking for an upgrade at some point. Not bad for the dolla"
MickyB,5,4 October 2021,"Love it, much loader than my previous one",Sound quality good

DIYDave,5,28 September 2021,Excellent speaker for the Garden,We use this in the garden when sitting in our pergola. The speaker is connected via bluetooth to an Alexa speaker and works great at approx 15 metres.
RD,3,28 September 2021,Ok for the price,Sonos this is not!Ok speaker for the price but don’t let your expectations get the better of you. Full volume a little disappointing for a speaker to be used outdoors.
Piergaetano I.,5,26 September 2021,Good and steady product,"Easy to pair, very solid and good (buy not amazing) sound quality. More than enough in my shower"

Mr Clive Everitt,4,13 September 2021,Access to music from my phone with decent sound quality,Only had it a short while so asking about battery life at this stage is a bit premature but so far so good. Easy to set up and good sound quality and range
Amazon Customer,1,11 September 2021,Replacement that was worse than the first one I bought. Don’t waste your money on this.,"I bought this product and the second time I used it, it broke. It would turn on but wouldn’t play any music. I spoke to the seller and the sent a replacement, which plays music but after 19 mins it makes a piercing screeching sound then doesn’t work. So basically you will have decent sound for a total of 19 mins after each 8 hour charge. I honestly wouldn’t buy this product or waste your money."
Saurabh Singh,3,8 September 2021,Bass flat,Bass not good. Sounded flat. Otherwise ok.

Greig Thomas,5,10 August 2021,Great looking and sound.,This does have a great sound even at high volumes. Battery life is good. Only down side I've found is the hands free feature isn't loud enough to have a conversation.
Big Mac,5,9 August 2021,bloody brilliant,"great sound made the whole experience of listening to the Olympics assume, really great value for money"
Amazon Customer,5,8 August 2021,Very good,"I'm not a sound expert, just really needed a speaker to listen to my Spotify list instead of the phone speaker or headphones.

Amazon Customer,5,8 August 2021,Great product,"Brought this for when we’re out about,It’s a great little speaker"
John B.,4,5 August 2021,All round good very  portable speaker,"Very clear, crisp sound but a little lacking on the bass. It's loud for its size and so portable and though didn't check waterproof it seems to be with thick rubber protection over the sockets and ports at the back. It fits in my jeans pocket."

Lee,3,30 July 2021,Ok,Does drop Bluetooth connection from time to time
David Smith,5,29 July 2021,Great little speaker,"I don't usually write reviews but thought this little speaker earned one. I wasn't expecting too much for 32 Euro but was pleasantly surprised. First on the sound quality, for something this small I can't fault it. You are not going to use it for a house party but for bringing to the beach, on holiday etc. it's perfect. It's loud enough without distorting. I use mine with base boost on, seems to drop the mid and treble to enhance the base but works well in my opinion. I bought mine for our hot tub, wanted something that would take a few splashes (it fell in once) and not be an issue. Have been using on holiday for the last 5 days and still on the charge I gave it before we left, probably 8 hours of use."
pamela,5,29 July 2021,Son said grea,Bought for son he said much better than one he had before
gary alner,5,28 July 2021,Great value for money,"Great little Bluetooth speaker for the money. Sound quality is not the best but we only use it in the garden so you don't need anything better and lets not forget the price! Battery life is really good and it truely is waterproof, its been dropped in the hot tub twice and is still going strong."
Tom W,5,27 July 2021,Great speaker for the price.,"Very good speaker for the price. The sound qaulity stays clear while loud, the bass mode does knock the volume down a little but deffinately adds more bass and depth. Bluetooth connection works great even through walls it kept going, and being splash proof was very useful for use by the hot tub. Deffinately recommend compared to much pricer alternatives."
scubagirl,5,25 July 2021,Surprisingy great!,Surprised by the quality of the sound this little speaker produces! Really clear and good bass.Good build quality and def water resistant.
mr m w nicholls,5,23 July 2021,Really great 👍,"Wow,so much better than i was expecting. The sound is great and it packs a punch on volume too."

David Maccoby,4,20 July 2021,"Loud Series Bluetooth Speaker,",Good.
JonH,4,20 July 2021,"Works well, good quality sound for a small speaker","Used to play music when dining al fresco. Also used to play bird sounds to attract swifts to our swift box! Surprisingly good sound considering the size of the speaker. Only runs for about 3-4 hours if volume is set high, but that will not be a problem for most. The only fault is that there is no indication of when it is fully charged - the charging light just stays on whatever the state of charge. Good product and good value."
john kerr,3,19 July 2021,Nice speaker great sound,Nice little speaker clear sound use it in the garden and can hear it from the other side but on the downside if your using your phone and walk away from the speaker with it it disconnects after about 3 feet
Andy,5,19 July 2021,Just what we needed,Perfect for our outdoor bar. Tempted to get a second as you can link 2 devices for stereo.
Sharon,5,18 July 2021,It’s worth buying!,"I love everything about it. The speaker itself is really good, I would recommend this to anyone who are looking for a speaker they can travel with it etc. I rate it 10/10"
Shaun,1,18 July 2021,Product ok rubbish customer service,Product ok but the rear panel that covers the charge port doesn't stay closed so there is a potential for moisture to gain access to the unit . I have contacted the company to no avail.  Rubbish customer service .Would not recommend or buy again as customer service is garbage
p3r3e,3,18 July 2021,Average,"Has great reviews, but the Bluetooth connection keeps cutting out for a second when playing music."
JC,5,16 July 2021,Great value,I bought this as a portable solution for just taking down the garden when you’re doing jobs and for the price the power and quality are excellent.I realise this isn’t aimed at audiophiles and to review as such would be disingenuous and pointless; I also own some Audeze LCD-3 headphones so I know what real quality sounds like; but for getting the job done it’s fantastic.Can’t go wrong really.
Craig H,5,10 July 2021,Excellent quality all round speaker AND its rainproof.,Cracking little speaker! Use it for listening to music in the garden and great for quickly hooking up to laptop with Jack 2 phone and playing music music parties etc. Can go very loud without any distortion and very good quality. The fact it's rainproof just rounds it off perfectly.
Amazon Customer,3,10 July 2021,Not water proof,Good little speaker not very water proof tho!
Amazon Customer,5,9 July 2021,Nice sounds,"Nice, I'm very happy , super."
Eustace Augustus,5,9 July 2021,Brilliant,"Good product, I'm very happy with it"
Liam Forsyth,5,7 July 2021,Super smart little speaker,"I don’t normally write reviews for products but this nifty little speaker is an exception. For the price it is a fantastic bit of kit. Connecting to it is super easy and intuitive and it offers wired as well as Bluetooth connections. The battery life is very good and the product is build really well and feels solid. The fact it is waterproof too means it’s perfect for having out by the hot tub.The sound quality is also really good with a good top volume. It’s obviously not studio quality or surround sound but for the price you really can’t have any complaints.Fully recommend this, really pleased with my purchase."
Amazon Customer,5,6 July 2021,OUTSTANDING!!,Outstanding sound!!! The quality is so good that we are going to use it at our wedding ceremony in a weeks time. The battery life is very good and the volume of sound it puts out is phenomenal  .... without any distortion

Elizabeth,5,27 June 2021,Super,Amazing product.  Highly recommend.
sledge,1,25 June 2021,Good while it works !,"When I first got this it was great , quite a good sound (not sure about the bass boost, turned it on then straight off= pointless) and battery life was good.2 months later its heading for the bin ,, the bluetooth connectivity has given up , no devices I  or my friends have can find it ,,I do think a lot of these devices are made by the same company the adverts and listings do seem very similar !It annoys me that these products are simply replaced cheaply."
TLM,5,25 June 2021,Good solid product,"Charged to go straight out of the box, which was an unexpected bonus. It IS very 'bassy'. It has two settings: Bass on and off. There is a difference between the two, but both are 'low'. It doesn't seem to distort at top level and it's a 'socialable' sound level in consideration of others. I shall stick it in my camping bag and use it outdoors, where I expect it will be perfect."
Gillian wilson,5,24 June 2021,Excellent for the money,Sound quality is really good for the price. It has bass boost but you don’t really need it.

Kobi,5,12 June 2021,Definitely would but again,"This speaker is actually the best one I’ve found for value, originally I was just looking for a small speaker that I can take into work with me but this speaker had gone above and beyond, I haven’t tested the waterproof ability but everything else is perfect, battery lasts all day and it’s very load for its size.Definitely recommend for the very good price"
davidpdavies,5,12 June 2021,Compact but loud,"Great sound quality, good bass, overall a great way of playing ya tunes via Bluetooth."
Amazon Customer,5,11 June 2021,Best portable speaker so far,So I've had this product for a few days now just for indoors and gardens. I must say it's worth buying .

Andrew J,5,10 June 2021,It is very very good,When I switched it on I couldn't believe it. The bass and clarity of music really shocked me. I would totally recommend this wireless speaker to anybody who needs a little Bluetooth speaker that packs one hell of a punch.
Mr. M.R.C. Tomlin,4,9 June 2021,Review on Bluetooth speaker,This device worked well and was full charged up when it turned up and connected to my phone straight away
Kelly Webb,5,8 June 2021,"Small, powerful and easy to use! Perfect!!!","Only arrived today, and already rocking out in the garden! Sound quality is great and easy to use."
djrhodes,1,8 June 2021,30 days old and already one of the speakers is dead!,Great for the Price!
Kim,3,7 June 2021,A little too quiet,"Bought this b/c the sound on one of my laptops is too quiet. This certainly helped but I admit, I still wish it could go louder. For anything that already has decent volume (like a phone or a better laptop), it's good, so I kept it."
Twinkle dark heart,5,6 June 2021,Sounds amazing,"Omg this little speaker is amazing,  really good sound at full volume.  Easy to connect,  comes with hanging cord."
Z,5,6 June 2021,Wow,"Blown away, great product  great lrice"
C. V.,5,3 June 2021,Excellent speaker,The sound is perfect and size works great for a desktop speaker. I hook it up to bluetooth to my laptop and play it all day long (literally) and it works fantastic!
AM,5,1 June 2021,Ok,Find it useful. It’s ok for what I need.
David Howarth,5,1 June 2021,Very impressed for the price,"Only had it for a day, but so far I am very impressed by the sound.  Definitely need to have the Bass mode on, but for the cost and size its really nice.  Have used it at home and at the park and no issues with sound at all.  Connected very easily to my phone and laptop both."
WillWales,5,1 June 2021,Good,"Great connectivity, holds a very decent charge and an attractive design 👍"
Nidas,5,25 May 2021,Bluetooth Speaker,"The media could not be loaded.                      Love this device,so helpful to use my Spotify through the phone so I could use this speakers to get some mood on:) sound is good,like the actual size and really nice buy.Would recommend it if you like to play music from your phone or other devices."
james stirling,5,25 May 2021,Excellent performance for price,"I'm using it as bedroom practice amp for guitar using a looper and sdrum and British sound harley benton distortion pedal. Sound is excellent and audibly far superior to using my high output instrument does not deal that well with looped guitar tracks and drums, it behaves more like a hifi system and provides a well balanced sound with no distortion where it shouldn't be. It also pairs easily with devices and sounds impressive for size. Output for use with guitar and effects via aux input OK but don't expect it to be Glastonbury on a Saturday afternoon but for price excellent"
olivia yexley-alick,5,25 May 2021,Brilliant speaker!,What a fantastic speaker! The sound quality is amazing and the bass is brilliant! And the battery life on it lasts for soooo long. What a great piece of equipment for little price.
Hafeez,5,24 May 2021,Perfect Gadget,I am using this over a week now and found very good. Sound is great in normal mode but when I switch to base mode its bit heavy indoors and when I use it outdoors it’s brilliant. Its good little gadget for household use.
Anmar N.,5,22 May 2021,Recommended,"Good speaker, volume is adequate, water proof as back connections are protected, can join Alexa family, easy to use and pair, for the price it’s great."
Andrew Maxim,3,19 May 2021,Decent,"Great speaker, very good sound and battery life. However if you move more than about 10feet from the speaker, the connection get really crackly"
weepollypocket,4,18 May 2021,Brilliant little device,Brilliant little device.  Not as much Bass as I'd hoped for but great none the less. Doesn't connect to Huawei phones but there is a coax cable in the box to solve the issue.
Leigh G.,5,18 May 2021,Very good,For its size this Is a good little speaker.. doesn't sound bad at all and is great to hang in the shower and as a bonus it works as a mini sound bar for my tv... great product and am happy with my purchase
Giuseppe,5,16 May 2021,Very impressed by the sound quality,"I was very impressed by the sound quality, very clear and loud. It's much better than many other more expensive speakers.I got in on offer in a multiple items purchase from the same seller and I'm very satisfied.The battery life it's awesome and the Bass Mode gives an extra punch improving the overall sound quality."
Cameron McKenzie,4,14 May 2021,Tunes,"Good product goes quite loud, however the bass mode doesn’t seem to make much off a difference but could just be me not noticing. Over all good speaker."
Amazon Customer,4,13 May 2021,Great little speaker,"This little speaker has great sound and is compact. I haven't had any issues with it, but I've only had it a few weeks and have used it a few times."
Sumiya,5,12 May 2021,Bluetooth speakers,I love it. It's great. The sound quality is brilliant.
Richard Johnson,5,11 May 2021,Good little speaker,It's really good for the price. If you just want a speaker for doing housework it's really good. It's moderately loud. Good bass. Doesn't distort. Really good Bluetooth range.

Ymonz,4,7 May 2021,Brilliant Speaker,"The speaker is brilliant! I particularly like that I can add more bass if I need to. Only downside is that the battery runs out quickly, but other than that it’s a very good buy."
coofercat,5,7 May 2021,Great little speaker,"This is a great little speaker for the size/price etc. Sure, it's not Wharfdale quality, it's probably not even Beats ""quality"" - but it does a reasonable job of making noises, has a good battery and is pretty tough. Whatever it is, it's about a zillion times better than listening to anything through your phone directly - and it's not exactly a big investment, or a big device to carry about.It's been great around and about, but yeah, we've had to tell the kids to turn it down quite often, even though it's not exactly ear-splitting, it gets loud enough that the neighbours have to put up with the kids music - and lets be honest, no one wants that. Even still, it's unlikely to upset anyone nearby too much - they're hardly going to be getting thumping bass and window-rattling trebles off this, so in some sense it's fairly self-limiting.All in all, for the money, it's been a great little purchase. Would recommend."
Lewis M.,5,5 May 2021,Great to have when you are working outside,Great wee speaker
igorvalcu,5,1 May 2021,ldl,"i think is a good speaker, good materials but u can find one better for less money"
S Baggley,5,29 April 2021,"Great quality, great sound, great price and highly waterproof.","Bought as a present for my son to use in the shower. He absolutely loves it. The sound quality is apparently excellent, with a really deep bass in ""bass mode"". For such a small unit it packs plenty of punch, with more than enough volume to fill a room, which means it can be deafening in a small shower cubicle. Unlike some supposedly waterproof speakers, this one is rated IPX7, which means it can in theory be submerged in up to 1m of water for up to an hour. My son hasn't tested that, but he says the speaker gets pretty wet in the shower and still works great. He's also very impressed with the bluetooth range, which plays music from his laptop on one side of the house into the bathroom on the other without any stuttering. Buttons on the top of the speaker let you adjust the volume, skip forwards/backwards through a playlist, pause, etc. Battery life is also excellent. Can't really fault this device, and at £29.99 it was a bargain."
Rugbyjock,5,26 April 2021,Great value for money!!,"I brought this for my garage gym, best money I’ve every spent .Dirt cheap , sound is brilliant , my mother could sync it , battery life quiet good too and when it is dead just plug it in and while charging you can still listen away"

Tina Hines,5,11 April 2021,Great quality at a low price,Wasn’t really sure how good the quality of this would be due to the low price but I have to say I was not disappointed.I brought this so I could listen to music off my phone while working out down the bottom off my garden in my summerhouse.It sounds great and can go really loud and have the bass up and no ones affected. 😍😍
Marcin,5,11 April 2021,Amazing,Amazing
Miss D.,3,10 April 2021,Disconnects from Bluetooth randomly,So it is a good speaker. I have mine running for long periods (over night with noise cancelling white noise or sleep aid and daily with music). Every so often the speaker disconnects itself from Bluetooth. It is really annoying. If you only use for short periods - it is a good speaker but if like me you use constantly - it is not.
S,5,10 April 2021,A super speaker,This was such a good price for such a great speaker! I use it all the time and the battery lasts really well! I like the bass feature and the overall volume and sounds quality is great too

Ricardo Azevedo,5,25 March 2021,Great water resistant BT speaker,"I bought this speaker to play music around the hot tub outside and the sound is very good, good bass and loud enough for the size. The fact that is water resistant is perfect if it rains. Very easy to pair with your phone. Battery life is very impressive, I've used it 2 consecutive times for over 2-3 hours each time on one full charge."

Danielle,2,21 March 2021,Doesn’t hold a charge,5 months old and no longer holds a charge
Mrs Bear6,5,20 March 2021,Superb  Speaker,"I bought one of these speakers and found them so good that I bought another four so I could have them dotted around my house. They replaced some more expensive mains powered Blaupunkt speakers. The sound quality and level is really surprising for the size, as is the base level output. Besides this they connect very quickly with my Oneplus phone as the have Bluetooth 5.0, and they and stay connected unlike, the Blaupunkt speakers that used Bluetooth 4.0 and timed out when I paused music for longer than 15 minutes.  Although these speakers are extremely portable (not much bigger than my phone, but much thicker, of course) I use them plugged into the mains for radio plays, podcasts and classical music."
Amazon Customer,5,19 March 2021,A really good product,"A great product, battery lasts well and sound quality is great"
amazonian,5,19 March 2021,This has been perfect for annoying neighbours!,"I have purchased many bluetooth speakers but I hope this to be my last for quite a while!  It's been GREAT!Since purchasing in February, I've not run out of power whilst in the garden, which is where I wanted it for most.  So far I've been in the garden for around 6 hours and it's kept going....and loudly!  Although not at full volume for the whole of the time, I really think it will be still good for the forthcoming summer months when I will be in the garden double that time.  It's covering is robust, the strap seems very well fixed and used all the time to hang from various hooks in the garden.  I had a discount voucher at the time - and a bonus speaker that I've not even opened the packaging - but I'd say it would still be worth around £30.  Certainly comparing to what one finds on the high street.  The volume is GREAT, the best I've had so far as better watts times two!I don't know how long it takes to recharge, I just plug it in once I'm back from the garden and switch off after a few hours.  I'm sure I saw its charge percentage on my phone once but I don't actively look for the information.Yes, I would recommend this speaker!"
S. G. Pathakji,5,19 March 2021,Great little speaker..,Very impressive sound from this little very lightweight speaker.  I would definitely recommend..
Andreas Teschner,5,18 March 2021,One is enough unfortunately...,"As they are already stereo, one can't pair them for true stereo sound. They work great on ones chest close to your face to watch movies and all else though! Love them."
Lyndsey Horrocks,5,18 March 2021,Amazed,Brilliant product I am surprised something so small can be so powerful
Nev  Dunn,4,18 March 2021,Good sound but charge and connect issues,"Battery life is a couple of hours. It doesn't have a charger plate like Bose so you then have to plug it into usb to charge.Also, it wont connect to the device of choice if other devices are connected by accident, so you have to go round turning off bluetooth on other devices"
T,1,17 March 2021,Quality,Item was faulty
S Wragg,1,16 March 2021,Sent it back,Poor quality sound!
Amazon Customer,5,15 March 2021,Every home should have one; or more!,"This has been transformative.  Radio is now a pleasure to hear, rather than an annoyance.  With free Amazon Music on Prime we have all been able to find music styles that we enjoy, enhanced by the sound quality of A15, rediscovering old passions.  The best thing has been the way we can now make the baby sleep with the soporific lullaby collections.  It is so portable!"
Derek Hodson,2,15 March 2021,Portable Speaker,Speaker cracked after 1 week so not worth the money. However sound quality was great up to that point.
Flavia,2,15 March 2021,Sound not clear.,after not ever 1 month the sound became robotic and it is just annoying.
marge simpson,1,15 March 2021,Rubbish power on button,It's a great speaker but power button is really had to press. I have to stand and put a lot of weight on it to turn on. Perhaps it's just mine or maybe a poor design. Not sure.
Sally Brown,5,13 March 2021,BASS IN YA FACE!! BOOM!!,"Smart looking, loud, clear sounds, OK battery life and dirty sounding bass.All in all, not a bad little buy! 😁If you can hear music 🎶 it's probably me! Lockdown Disco for ONE!!🙅‍♀️🙆‍♀️🙅‍♀️🙆‍♀️"

lee anderson,2,11 March 2021,Not great at all.,Not that loud at all and battery lasted about 3 hours not good
Kevin McCombs,5,10 March 2021,Absolutely purrrrfect 👍,My old Bluetooth portable speaker gave up after about 5 yrsSoo I needed another for the garageI play my music from my iPhone and rock radio stationThe sound quality is just absolutely A1 but a added bonus I had no idea aboutThe speaker has a inbuilt microphone which when your phone rings allows you to chat thru without touching your phone as it has a button on the speaker to receive callsMy point beingIf your hands are gloved and dirtyIt’s much better just using the speaker button rather than trying to pick up the phone and run the risk of dropping itAnyway that’s a massive bonus for meWhich takes this a 5star rating for me
Aled,5,10 March 2021,Really good,Really good
In the Trade I know best,2,10 March 2021,No longer charges!,"This was purchased as a gift in December. Speaker will no longer charge, I’m unsure if this is a common issue with this speaker or not? Disappointing as everything else about the speaker has been great."

Seambo,5,6 March 2021,Its all about the base,Tried a few wireless speakers now some more expensive than this.  An they werrnt great.  I love the base an loudness of this. Perfect for Garden or bathroom
TIM,1,5 March 2021,Expensive Compared to J&B. Time delay.,Compared to J&B this Chinese brand is more expensive. I got sucked into Amazon Choice twice now for low quality products. Not gonna happen again. There is a delay with this speak when used to watch TV or movies.
Ramblerman,5,5 March 2021,Nice speaker,Good price and reasonable sound.
Um,3,3 March 2021,Bog standard speaker,Expected it to mean much louder.It won't connect unless every other device has its Bluetooth switched off
Theo Stegeman,5,3 March 2021,Very good for the money and sound,Very good for the money and sound
onlineshopper,2,3 March 2021,Don't trust the description,"I returned this as the product description, packaging information and insert information did not match eachother and couldn't be trusted. I wanted a long range speaker but different ranges listed so didn't bother to try just got a refun instead. Warranty info also different. Don't trust brands like that, this stuff should be clear."
Lauren Jones,5,2 March 2021,Really happy with it,"Good sound, looks and feels solid, easy to use."
Lorelay,3,2 March 2021,Not as great as expected,"This is definitely not lasting the hours it states it should, maybe 12h tops. The sound quality isn't that great either, I have another speaker which is supposed to be less w than this (I ain't very good at this I'll admit) and sounds far more loud and clear than this one.Not the best, I guess for the money it is what it is. Hopefully it at least lasts for a while."

R. Ford,5,18 February 2021,Cracking little speaker,Wanted a speaker for the bathroom. Wasn't expecting much for £25. For the money I don't think you could do any better. Set up with daughters Echo device quickly enough but have opted to just use it as a Bluetooth speaker through my phone for now. Be ideal for BBQs. Like a party in the bathtub. Have tested it with Disney music for my daughter and the Prodigy so far. Very impressed with the sound. Have got it wet but yet to submerge it in water. Unsure on battery life yet.UpdateDaughter has used it as a submarine to test it. So has been submerged a few times. Still works fine. Have to shake water off but sound resumes. Have used many times in bathroom and garden so far in a single charge. Good battery life!

Very impressed.Comes with a male to male jack too if you don't want to use Bluetooth, and a micro USB charging cable in case you didn't already have loads.Surface is a matte black rubber, non-slip for the wet.The size is approximately 7 inches/18cm wide by 2 inches/5cm deep by 2.5inches/6cm tall. Fits nicely on my corner shower shelf.I've yet to test it out wet, but if it breaks I'll be returning it straight back as the only reason I've bought it is for the shower!Update, had it a few months now, works fine in the wet. Good battery too, rarely needs charging."
andy rudd,4,10 February 2021,Great small speaker,"just needed a bluetooth speaker for using outdoors. I'm amazed at the sound quality this pumps out considering I paid so low a price. Bass and treble are on point and at full pelt, it's great. Being wireless, it's totally portable; play music wherever you fancy. Battery life is great. it's super easy to recharge using the supplied USB cable. A well built and sturdy speaker which is underpriced in my opinion. One of my better buys."
kirstie,4,8 February 2021,Little but loud,"As expected, very loud for the price and nice sleek design."
Lifemaestro,1,6 February 2021,Appalling sound - it warbles and quavers!!!,"I owned this for just 10 minutes before boxing it back up and sending it straight back! Couldn't wait to get it out of the house!Both music and audio warbled and quavered. I thought, perhaps I was expecting too much for the money? Then my son walked in and begged me to turn it off! He said the sound was so ghastly he couldn't bear it.Scanning through the reviews, quite a few mention this, so I'm not convinced it was even faulty. I have purchased something completely different. Once bitten...."
Ken M,4,5 February 2021,Poor user manual,"Neat and compact unit but the tiny User Manual leaflet gives little information and the operating instructions need a magnifying glass to read. There is a button M on the controls but no mention of its function in the leaflet. Also no information on what indicates Fully charged’ as just a red light when plugged into USB. When switched on it automatically registered on my iPad but would not then connect with Alexa Echo, which said ‘no device found’. Took several days of trial and error until I went into the iPad Settings and removed it. As soon as I did this it connected to Alexa Echo so is now up and working."
Emilia,5,5 February 2021,Very pleased,Very good speaker

Andrew Taylor,4,2 February 2021,Well worth buying,Surprisingly good for the price!
Graeme B,5,2 February 2021,Excellent buy for the money,"For a well built, IPX7 waterproof Bluetooth speaker for £22 nobody should complain! It took me 3 seconds to connect to my iPhone Bluetooth.Plenty loud enough for a small to medium sized room on 75% volume. The bass + option tends to dampen down the treble rather than to increase the bass, so I find I need to turn up the volume. Press + button briefly to increase the volume or leave it pressed down for the next track or - for vice versa.If you are looking for a louder speaker with far more pronounced bass expect to pay double on something like the Transmart Force which I also own.Battery life is excellent- I haven’t needed to recharge it yet after a fortnight mainly using it at around 75% of the volume for approx 12 hours.Aux cable is straightforward to connect and Bluetooth range is very good."

Asitha H,5,22 January 2021,Great product. Love it.,"I have to say, I was a bit sceptical before buying this as I wasn’t sure how the sound quality was going to be given it is a tiny speaker. I was nicely surprised when I started using it. Bass boost packs a punch & I love this. It is looks high quality & connects seamlessly to iPhones & Alexa (Echo plus & Dots).And still waiting for the first battery charge to die down. Looks like the battery life is also very good.Nothing bad to say about the product. Love it."

The little hook of string to hang it from my shower fixture was a small but important difference to stop me knocking it on the shower floor all the time as I've done with other speakers.Great product, solid Bluetooth range. Enjoyable sound and convenient fitting accessory (the little string hook!)."

Ive been using the speaker in the kitchen while cooking, and it has surpassed all my expectations. Ok, It’s not perfect, but for the price it can push out good bass, and treble isn’t lost either. Haven’t used base boost yet. Not needed in my opinion."

Abison Mathew Jose,5,1 December 2020,Like it. Fair sound,"The speaker perform very good for me. I have not tested the water proof claim. Sound is really good and use more watching Netflix movies on laptop and music from mobile. One thing I noticed the audio some time realy awesome when we chose perfect audio profile in computer, e.g. dolby enable. Battery backup is good did not count the exact hours. In answer phone mode, the sound is not good."

steve,4,23 November 2020,Quality of Sound,"I use this both as a speaker for my PC and also as a remote speaker when eating outside. Sound Quality is great. Only problem is that the promised 100 feet connection is not achieved - more like 30 feet. But as I usually connect to my mobile when eating outside, this isn't a problem.It readily paired straight out of the box.the USB charging cable is a bit short for my liking at 700mm."
Amazon Customer,4,23 November 2020,Good sound quality and looks great,I like all the features.  The only problem I have with it is  if the control buttons had been a contrasting colour it would be easier to see them more clearly.

Amazon Customer,5,3 November 2020,Excellent product compact durable,Excellent
Rob in Shropshire,5,1 November 2020,Good companion for Alexa.,"Wanted a low cost / good value Bluetooth speaker for my shower room and having read the reviews this one appeared to score well across the board. I’m pleased to say, I’m not disappointed. The speaker was well packaged and Out of the box is a neat and tidy, compact design. There’s large clear buttons on the top providing easy operation and at the back a rubber waterproof cover for the recharging / aux ports. It paired very easily with echo dot via the Alexa app on iPhone and will both reconnect and disconnect simply by voice instruction to Alexa on the dot. Sound quality, in my opinion, is very good indeed for a small inexpensive speaker - it’s crisp and full. I’m not 100% convinced about the bass boost mode however, it seems to mute the top end rather than add at the bottom. For me, volume could be a little higher but it’s adequate. That said it delivers decent overall sound quality for my needs (music while I shower). It fits neatly on top of the bathroom mirror (see photos) and I have used it on the shelf in the shower itself with no problems, so its waterproof rating appears accurate. Charging usb lead is included - full charge is achieved in approx 45 mins and lasts 7/8 days the way I use it (while showering). Overall -very pleased."
Samuel O,1,1 November 2020,It cuts off....,I’ve just got this speaker yesterday (31st October) and now when I play my music the speaker randomly cuts off. It hasn’t been 24 hours yet and now it’s faulty. I do not recommend.
Amazon Customer,4,29 October 2020,Great little speaker and really quite powerful,Played through laptop which was really good and great sound. Only downside is I can't get it to connect to mobile.
Andrew B,5,29 October 2020,Good value and long battery life.,"Good value speaker with a long battery life. It means I can use the speaker with my phone to get streamed music and internet radio stations when I drive my old car with it’s outdated sound system. It also allows hands free phone use when driving. Remember to read the instruction leaflet - the buttons are a little confusing - to increase the volume, just press the + button briefly; if you hold the + button down, it doesn’t alter the volume but moves onto the next track."
RT,5,29 October 2020,Good Value Bluetooth Speaker,Bought for use with Tablet. Was easy to pair and is working well
Amazon Customer,5,28 October 2020,Happy with the purchase,"I got this speaker for my daughter and she is very happy about the product, good battery life and good noise level. Thanks"

Ken Baker,5,25 October 2020,True to the add,"Can't fault it ,bought it for the garden and BBQs ,yes it dose what it says on the box excellent"
S P O`Callaghan,4,22 October 2020,"Nearly perfect, but more than good enough","For less than £20 I wanted something to listen to in the shower. Looked around and this seemed a bargain, esp, with discount on offer!Works very easily and packs a punch, so much so, I need to find a level not to scare neighbours.My only grumble is that whilst there is a 'bass' boost, there is nothing for 'treble', which seems to be the case on all products like this. Don't discriminate against treble!Anyway, great product and sound, nothing more to say"
karen,5,22 October 2020,Lovely sound,"Brilliant, but can never use it as my daughter always has it lol"
Shannan,5,18 October 2020,Perfect travel speaker.,Definitely worth the money.
G,5,18 October 2020,Compact But Power Packed,Sound quality very good.  Excellent value for money.
Michelle Cottrell,5,17 October 2020,Does exactly what it says,Excellent when out in the garden.
Greg,5,15 October 2020,"Frequency range: 120- 20.000 Hz, Can play while charging","Pros:+Very loud for a small party, u dont need it on full volume if u wanna have a conversation. Perhaps 50% is too much as well.+Huge battery life. Havent tested it on full volume and full battery to see how long it will last, but if ur alone, the claimed 20hrs are possible.+Nice bass (i listen to rap songs), although the box say its range starts from 120 Hz and not 20 Hz, that the human ear can hear. This should be on the product description here on Amazon.+Bass mode doesnt do this much for more bass, but normal mode is awesome as well, its bass is clearly heard and felt.+Charger, aux to aux and little rope on the side of the speaker are included.+Doesnt lose quality on full volume plus +15dB from the preamp on the phone app.-Negative:-Mentioned it before too: sound range starts from 120 Hz, and it should be stated on the product''s page here on Amazon.---> Verdict:Its probably the best, clearest and most powerful at the same time speaker for 25 english pounds or 30 Euros."
Dan,5,15 October 2020,Great purchase,"Bought as a present for my Niece and she absolutely loves it, the sound is great and battery life is long"

Amazon Customer,5,11 October 2020,great,Long lasting battery life be for charging noise level good
Jed,5,11 October 2020,Quality Sounding Speaker,"I was pleasantly surprised with the sound that came out of this small speaker.  The bass and treble are crisp and clear even at full vol.  Being wireless, it is totally portable so you can play music on the go when ever you like.  Battery life is great. It was on 90% when I took it out of the box.  I've used it for a few hours over a few days and it's still on 90%.  Easy to charge using the supplied USB cable.  This can also be connected to devices using the AUX cable that is also in the box.This is a well built and sturdy speaker which does not disappoint!!"
Tom Williams,5,8 October 2020,Excellent,"I use these for providing music to dance tango outdoors. The volume is more than adequate and the quality is fine. I have started using them indoors because, although I have an proper sound system, setting it up takes a few minutes and these speakers are perfectly good enough and ultra convenient to set up.We've danced to them for hours and not seen the battery level drop below 90%."
Ahmed A.,5,8 October 2020,Amazing value for a decent speaker,"For the budget range, Anker was the king of all speaker but, they have been increasing their price slowly so I was looking into a different brand.I came across this beast while researching on youtube and I have to say, I am so glad I purchased this. The sound quality is better than average for the small amount you pay.  I mainly use it when I am watching movies, youtube or listening to some podcasts. It has performed very well in all those cases. The connectivity is perfect due to bluetooth 5.0 and the bass is also very good.Battery seems to last ages so that's also great. It even supports micro sd playback which I will probably never use but its a nice feature to have.The design is very minimal and simple which is rare these days. Also it is water resistant which is assuring but I do not plan on testing it anytime soon!Only thing to me mindful of is that at full volume, the high tones are  distorted somewhat but I already expected that as even Anker speakers have the same problem.If you are looking for very solid speaker for a small budget, this is a must buy."
S 9 C,5,7 October 2020,Bluetooth Speaker,"The speaker is easy enough to pair via Bluetooth with my iphone. Sound quality out of it is decent and I mainly use spotify as my main music player. This is IPX7 rated so even if it gets wet, it will continue to work just fine. There are buttons on the top of it where you can control functions such as volume, play/pause and, on/off. Battery life has been great off it too and I haven’t needed to charge it so far from my use. (should last upto 20 hours*)"
Mr. Glenn Harris,3,7 October 2020,"Not the bargain you hope, but okay.","Poor battery life (in some instances, less than 3 hours), subpar build quality (the charger cable feels like it's barely in) and it's really fussy with what charger it can take power from.Buy cheap, buy twice.On the plus side, the external costing is pretty robust as it hadn't shown any real marks. Sound quality isn't bad but there are much better alternatives out there. Good for a speaker you can throw in your bag without caring about it too much."
David Jones,5,4 October 2020,Great,The style is cool sounds great

The Rev,5,2 October 2020,Solid. Really good sound for size. Good value!,It is exactly what I was looking for.  A good bluetooth speaker at a good price.  I needed a speaker to take out to the shed when I work.  This one will fill a good size with sound.  Easy to connect.  Nice that you can put music on a micro SD card as well.  Can't go wrong.
Adam Rogers,5,30 September 2020,Great,Great sound and for the money
Maddy Cooling,5,27 September 2020,Great quality,"Would definitely recommend it’s really loud, works perfect, quality’s great and you can actually tell a difference when bass mode is on"
Sami,3,27 September 2020,It's ok,Not the best sound quality.I don't like the loud on and off sound it makes. It's also picking mobile phone interference.
Iva,5,27 September 2020,"I love this thing, so worth the money!","Super impressed with the quality given the price, this little gadget is my best friend now, especially when it’s my turn to clean the house, i stick a 90’s dance tunes compilation and terrorise the neighbours to my heart’s content, took it to the beach, watch my tv shows on it, it’s great, absolutely recommend!"
Keith Plumb,4,26 September 2020,Good for the price.,"Purchased as a replacement for a boom bar, no where near the volume or sound quality but at the price it is excellent value."
Kit87,5,26 September 2020,Bought for the bathroom,"Bought this to use in our bathroom after dropping my Anker speaker in the bath! And it’s a lot better than I expected! Sound is good, battery hasn’t run out yet from initial charge on day one. So seems good value so far."
angie,5,26 September 2020,Sturdy little speaker with decent volume output.,"Lovely little speaker 2nd time around. 1st one had disturbing interference noise always in the background. Customer service was fantastic though and sent a new one straight out and it works perfectly. It’s not a boom box but the sound is ample enough for listening outside and indoors. The Bluetooth connection works every time and on different devices. For the price, quality and excellent after sales care I’m so pleased I chose this one and would recommend. Can’t thank customer service enough for all of their help :-)"
Daren Munro,4,25 September 2020,Good sound,"Good sound, easy to set up. Worth the money!"
g j hunt,4,25 September 2020,Good value,Nothing to dislike
Mordew Sr,5,25 September 2020,Good Sound,"The media could not be loaded.                      This speaker has amazing sound quality for the price, bought this for our lad as he wanted a speaker to connect to other things, and at the price I was very surprised with what it can do and the sound quality it keeps even at high volume."
Alex E,5,24 September 2020,"Ok for the reduced price,if your not fussy.","It's ok for the reduced price but 25 odd is too much, considering what you can get for an extra tenner.Mine arrived today,as pictured but I think the reviews over rate it a bit too much,lol.It sounds clear not very loud,as it's only 14w,7w a speaker,not much better than my 6 year old one,I bought from Amazon,still going strong.Just wanted an upgrade from my old Audio Dynamic cc speaker but it's old with micro usb,tf card,aux,etc.Didnt realise this new modern speaker was also micro usb and NOT TYPE C like most, that was a deal breaker and the loudness compared to my old unit which cost 35 back then.So I have opted for the Tronsmart Force 20 X 20 w type c for 35 at reduced price,as I own 3 Tronsmart products all great and customer service satisfaction.Can't comment on battery,as not owned it long enough.Bass boost did seem to add a bit more bass,then you seem to lose clarity and loudness drops.My honest opinion."
Adeel J.,5,22 September 2020,Good buy,Daughter very happy with this speaker
Timothy Storrs,5,20 September 2020,Perfect for my needs at a good price,Everything I expected and at a good price
Mark Cornell,5,17 September 2020,Utterly Amazing!,This arrived literally 5 mins ago and I’m already feeling compelled to write a review. Sound quality is great for something this size  and this thing is insanely loud for something so small with no distortion. It’s a really good solid build quality and looks like it will stand up to plenty of knocks. Water sealing looks good too. Perfect for my shower!
westhill_boy,5,17 September 2020,Great sound for a small Bluetooth speaker,"Great size, good sound quality, easy to connect and battery life seems fine. Thoroughly pleased with this buy and so would heartily recommend!"
Tom Blower,4,16 September 2020,Great value,Great compact speaker perfect for taking around with you.
g carey,5,15 September 2020,Bang for buck,Great value for money and robust build quality.....
Nish,5,14 September 2020,Great value speaker,"Very happy with this speaker. Very good alternative to JBL or Bose speaker being extremely clear in audio quality and an amazing battery life of 20 hours. It’s very easily portable and light so can be taken wherever, for me that’s hiking or by the pool on holiday. Another impressive feature is the IPX7 rating ensuring it is waterproof enough not too be damaged, unlike many other speakers I have come by. I also find that the matte black finish is very stylish. For this price I would highly recommend it as a buy and confidently do it is worth the value."
Benson,5,13 September 2020,Small enough to fit in a small handbag,"The media could not be loaded.                      This water proof speaker is perfect for small function when you don't have the space or electrical socket for speaker set up, we used it for some background music at a small reception and it worked perfectly with Bluetooth to my phone.Even at max volume there is little distortion but I would recommend turn it all the way to max when you hear ""beep beep"" then turn it back down by 4 clicks. That seems to be the sweet spot for this speaker at max volume. It is like Day and night compare to phone speakers, see my video next to my pictures for the comparison.I won't call this waterproof but more splash proof, there are open ports and sd card slots and the only thing stopping water going in is that plastic flap which does not have locking mechanism. I am sure it will be OK pool side with a bit of splash but I will not be dunking it in the water anytime soon.Had it playing continuously for 4 hours and battery indicator only gone down by less than half."
Canadrian,5,13 September 2020,Nice little unit,"I really like this little unit. It delivers a full and hefty sound, charges surprisingly quickly with a smart socket, and makes Bluetooth pairs really easily. It's good too that its controls give you a measure of remote control over source devices."
Andrew,5,11 September 2020,Great sound and quality,"This is a great speaker! The sound quality is really good, it gives a very clear and deep quality of sound. It is very tactile and really well made. My wife told me to turn it down and my teenager looked jealous, that says it all 😁"
Jeannette,5,8 September 2020,Wonderful!,Love it!
J,2,6 September 2020,Constant buzzing noise when connected,"When connected to my laptop or phone, there is always a slight buzzing noise which is pretty irritating."
Sduffbird,5,6 September 2020,Excellent for the price,Brilliant little speaker! Excellent battery life and decent sound. Great for using in the garden/outdoors etc...
kingsley busumunu,5,6 September 2020,Good,Easy to use and good sound quality
Mr R,5,5 September 2020,Solid Bluetooth Speaker.,"I bought this as a gift for my brother. Being a little cautious I gave it a quick test through music from my smartphone with a heavy rock track, jazz track, and an electronic mini mix track. I'm not an audio expert but I can say for myself I really liked how it sounded - had a clear ""even"" sound at default (it does have a bass mode which I didn't try as its not really my style). I didn't hear any distortions even at max volume (which can easily fill a room and probably loud enough to use outside with a group of people)."
Clare,5,5 September 2020,Excellent sound quality,Excellent product. Amazing value for money
Debbikinst,3,3 September 2020,"A review of seller, not product",The speaker had a buzzing noise and it seems its a common problem. The seller couldn't have been more helpful. They have developed the product which is available end Oct. In meantime have sent me a mini speaker to use. (Which is great!) I will update product review when I receive it.
Sam P,5,31 August 2020,Exactly as specified,Exactly as specified
Hollyluia,5,28 August 2020,Good buy.,Sturdy. Good sound. I like having control of the music without having to use my phone- especially in the shower.Good buy.
Karen,5,27 August 2020,Great little speaker,These are really loud and clear.Great!
Patrick Campbell,5,26 August 2020,Amazing sound quality for the price.,"I just needed a cheap bluetooth speaker for my son. I'm amazed at the sound quality this pumps out considering I paid so low a price. Bass and treble are on point and at full pelt, it's great. I didn't actually realise woofers were inbuilt until after I purchased and re-read the description. Being wireless, it's totally portable; play music wherever you fancy. Battery life is great. For me, a full charge lasted over a week and it's super easy to recharge using the supplied USB cable. A well built and sturdy speaker which is underpriced in my opinion. One of my better buys."
S. A,4,25 August 2020,Looking like used before has some demege marks,The product looks like used before and have marks like someone drop down the item but sounds its good
michael swales,5,24 August 2020,very good sound.,"This bluetooth speaker was exactly what I was looking for. It is small in size but with a very good sound quality. The unit also comes with a microSD slot to put your favourite songs onto, which is very useful. My one small criticism is that the buttons are hard to see in dim light, apart from that I am very happy with the unit & would recommend it."
Darren Greener,5,23 August 2020,nice,Good
Elizabeth,5,21 August 2020,"Bluetooth speaker, great value",Great value and easy to move around
Rob,4,19 August 2020,Handy speaker,Bought to use in garden plus when away on hols - handy quick Bluetooth connection plus good sound output with added bass option
Bob Rodgers,5,19 August 2020,New Speaker,Bought this speaker after my last one (Much smaller) was left outside for one night and never worked again. I bought this as it is shower proof! Looks great and the sound is really so much better than the smaller round one that I had. At about twice the cost as the other one it is well worth the extra.
Daniella Fyfe,5,17 August 2020,Great speaker,Wow this little speaker is great ! So easy to connect and clear at high volume. I used it in the garden and loved it. Great quality and price.
robin crowther,5,12 August 2020,BIG sound from such a small speaker,"Excellent sound & fantastic bass, I was surprised at the quality of the sound from this £25.00 speaker it punches well above its price tag, its almost a match for bose bluetooth speakers."
Bryan,5,10 August 2020,brilliant,Absolutely amazing Bluetooth speaker excellent sound and quality
PROS & CONS,5,8 August 2020,🔊 Small but mighty! This is a must have in any household!,"The media could not be loaded.                      Such a low-cost speaker with such great sound.I am loving it!First of all for copyright purposes, I’ve played Tones and I - Dance Monkey (official video)To show you not only the incredible sound but also the BASS on / BASS off function which is 🔊 Amazing!Pros-IPX 7 it can be submerged in up to 1m of water for 30 minutes without any issues-Rich Bass modeI hope the great difference can be appreciated in the video-A total of 14W drive speakers (2x 7W) Which brings incredible HD sound!-2200mAh batteryIt charges at 5V 1A / 5W standard charge, so I recommend you leave the speaker to charge over night.By the way the charging cable is included!The battery will last 10hours play time at full blast or 20hours at 50% volume.-Bluetooth 5.0 connectionEasy to connect (as seen on the video)Stable connection with great range-It can connect with multiple devices via Bluetooth.Simply connect one device, turn the Bluetooth on that device off, turn the speaker Off and back On and repeat the Bluetooth pairing.So far I’ve connected three devices without any issues.-It supports TF cardTake your downloaded music with you and simply press the M button.The speaker starts playing from the card instead than Bluetooth connection.This is without a doubt a little but mighty speaker which every household should have."
Melanie Hammond,5,6 August 2020,Awful crackling sound ( Edited) All sorted now,"Very disappointed in this product. I have only used it twice but the speaker keeps making a crackling sound, so had to take out my other bluetooth speaker and use that instead.... Awful product :-(Edited: Supplier got back to me and will be sending me a replacement. Great customer service - Hence changing the Review"
