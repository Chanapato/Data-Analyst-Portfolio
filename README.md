# PORTFOLIO
## Hi there!
### Welcome to my portfolio
My name is Chanapat Orachorn. I am a recent graduate in Big Data and Data Science, passionate about using data analytics to solve problems and enhance business performance.

I also have experience in using a range of technologies and tools to gather, organise and analyse data to support business decisions. This includes Python, SQL, Tableau, Excel and SAP.

This portfolio includes several kinds of projects that demonstrate my analytical skills and ability to use a variety of tools to present data in an understandable and clearÂ way.

### My projects

- Transformed raw data into meaningful information and analysed by using MySQL, resulting in discovering actionable insights which can help the shop to minimise costs and optimise the business.

#### [Yacht Charter (SQL)](https://github.com/Chanapato/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/main/SQL/Yacht%20Charter)
