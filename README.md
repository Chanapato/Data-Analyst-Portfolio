# PORTFOLIO
## Hi there!
### Welcome to my portfolio
My name is Chanapat Orachorn. I am a recent graduate in Big Data and Data Science, passionate about using data analytics to solve problems and enhance business performance.

I also have experience in using a range of technologies and tools to gather, organise and analyse data to support business decisions. This includes Python, SQL, Tableau, Excel and SAP.

This portfolio includes several kinds of projects that demonstrate my analytical skills and ability to use a variety of tools to present data in an understandable and clearÂ way.

### My projects

#### [Web Scrapping and Sentiment Analysis (Python)](https://github.com/Chanapato/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Web%20Scrapping%20and%20Sentiment%20Analysis)
- Extracted customer product reviews from Amazon using Splash and BeautifulSoup.
- Analysed customer reviews by getting the most frequent used words from WordCloud to visualise what customers talking about the product.
- Utilised Textblob for sentiment analysis, which is Natural Language Processing (NLP), to analyse and identify texts from customer reviews and determine if the emotional tone of the message is positive, negative or neutral.

#### [Coffee Shop Sales Analysis (SQL & Tableau)](https://github.com/Chanapato/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/main/SQL/Coffee%20Shop%20Sales%20Analysis)
- Analysed sales data from POS to understand customer behaviour and shop profit and loss.
- Transformed raw data into meaningful information and analysed by using MySQL, resulting in discovering actionable insights which can help the shop to minimise costs and optimise the business.
- Designed visually impactful and easy-understanding dashboards in Tableau based on SQL data.

#### [Yacht Charter (SQL)](https://github.com/Chanapato/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/main/SQL/Yacht%20Charter)
- Identified the use case scenario and broke down the problem into a procedural flow to design an effective Entity-Relationship diagram using Crow Foot notation and implement the database and tables using MySQL.
- Organised data in an unstructured file into designed tables, imported data from an Excel file and conducted data cleaning.
- Developed SQL code to test the database and answered business challenges.

#### [Demand Forecasting (Machine Learning)](https://github.com/Chanapato/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Demand%20Forecast)
- Addressed an issue of inaccurate customer demand prediction in a food-to-go company, leading to high waste.
- Analysed sales data and specified the key factors affecting customer demand through variable analysis, data preprocessing, and feature engineering. Using Inter Quartile Range method to detect outliers, time series decomposition for non-stationary data, one-hot encoding for nominal data, and MinMaxScaler for numerical features.
- Created regression models with hyperparameters optimisation (linear regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and voting regressor) to predict customer demand using time series forecasting techniques. 
- Achieved an RMSE of 9.21 using the voting regression model.
