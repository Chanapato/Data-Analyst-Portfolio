# SQL Portfolio - B3 Route Coffee Shop
## Introduction
I find it interesting to analyse data for my sister's coffee shop, a small business in Thailand known as B3 Route. Earlier, she has never looked back at the data and never thought that we could do something with the data she has got. Thus, I decided to support her figure out some insights that she might not know yet to help her make a better decision.\
\
Due to a few limitations in terms of products' cost, other expenditures data and being a new business, I could not analyse every aspect. Therefore, in this project, I will perform an exploratory analysis focused on sales data collected from the coffee shop's POS. I will use data collected from September 2020, which is the first month the shop opened until June 2021.\
\
Please note that this is my first project, feel free to give your suggestion for my further development.
## Posing Questions
I found some interesting questions after looking at data and having conversation with my sister - the only one stakeholder. Below is a list of interesting insights to explore:
1. How much is the revenue each month? and what is the trend?
2. Which product category generates the best sales each month?
3. What products should they increase stocks?
4. What date does the coffee shop normally have less customers?
5. What time of the day should they hire more staff?
## Data Exploration and Visualisation
###### Findings:
* Revenue has significantly dropped in Febauary and April. (However, that caused by the nation lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic)
* Approximately 50% of ordering is coffee, which is the largest proportion every month.
* Top 5 best seller products are only coffee and tea.
* Slower sales in the middle of the month, from 12 to 16.
* Customers are likely to visit the shop at 8AM and from noon to 1PM, which is 38.62% out of total number of customers.

To complete this analysis, I have created the sale summary dashboard focused on necessary details and visualisations to show sales over time per customers and product category.\
